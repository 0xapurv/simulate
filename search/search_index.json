Setting Up Simulate \u00b6 Make sure you have Flutter installed ( https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install ) Fork the repository Clone the forked repository: git clone https://github.com/[YOUR USERNAME]/simulate.git Connect a device or run an emulator (Make sure your connected device has USB Debugging enabled) Navigate to the project directory and Run: cd simulate flutter run Building your stuff \u00b6 Fixing a bug: \u00b6 Open an issue or report on gitter Make a new branch git checkout -b [BRANCH NAME] Fix the bug, push and open a pull request Adding a new Simulation: \u00b6 Discuss the idea first on gitter or just open an issue with the template. Discuss with the maintainers and get a simulation ID assigned. Build your simulation and open a PR! Setting Up Docs \u00b6 Install mkdocs and its requirements python3 -m pip install mkdocs pymdown-extensions mkdocs-material Check the installations by: mkdocs --version If this doesn't work, try restarting the terminal Use the below command to host the documentation on local server mkdocs serve --dev-addr 127 .0.0.1:8000 MkDocs supports live reload so you don't have to run the server again and again. Just make your changes in the docs and you'll see the change immediately. All the documentation is present in the docs directory. Don't hesitate in asking questions, it's a part of learning and everyone is here to help.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/#setting-up-simulate","text":"Make sure you have Flutter installed ( https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install ) Fork the repository Clone the forked repository: git clone https://github.com/[YOUR USERNAME]/simulate.git Connect a device or run an emulator (Make sure your connected device has USB Debugging enabled) Navigate to the project directory and Run: cd simulate flutter run","title":"Setting Up Simulate"},{"location":"contributing/#building-your-stuff","text":"","title":"Building your stuff"},{"location":"contributing/#fixing-a-bug","text":"Open an issue or report on gitter Make a new branch git checkout -b [BRANCH NAME] Fix the bug, push and open a pull request","title":"Fixing a bug:"},{"location":"contributing/#adding-a-new-simulation","text":"Discuss the idea first on gitter or just open an issue with the template.
